# csc207assginment1

This assignment has you design a set of classes for maintaining a mock ;ile system and interacting with it in a program that operates like a Unix shell.

You are NOT REQUIRED to implement any commands in Assignment1 (except for the exit command).
Hence spend more time towards Task1 in order to get a good mark for this assignment.. Again you are not asked to implement any of the commands except for the exit command.

Your program needs to support the equivalents of these bash commands 

exit

mkdir DIR

cd DIR

ls

pwd

mv OLDFILE NEWFILE

cp OLDFILE NEWFILE

cat FILE

get URL

echo STRING > OUTFILE

echo STRING >> OUTFILE

Create a set of CRC cards that could be used to implement the shell described. Instead of handing in your index cards, there is a directory named crcCards in your subversion repository. In crcCards, for each card that create, create a text file (with a .txt with the name of the class. 

you do not need to make any of the commands work; this is only to get you started writing the shell before Assignment2 begins. Your main focus for this Assignment1 is towards the CRC cards.
